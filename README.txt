This is a library for TFT displays controlled by SPFD5408. It's based on stevstrong's Adafruit_TFTLCD_8bit_STM32(https://github.com/stevstrong/Adafruit_TFTLCD_8bit_STM32), who ported Adafruit's TFTLCD-Library https://github.com/adafruit/TFTLCD-Library to STM32.

To use it, place it in <YourUserFolder>\Documents\Arduino\libraries\ or in your Arduino IDE click the "Sketch" menu and then Include Library => Manage Libraries, then find zip file with library.
